  <h2>Who This Freelance Hourly Rate Calculator Is For</h2>

  <p>
    This calculator is useful for freelancers who want a clearer and more
    structured way to price their work, including:
  </p>

  <ul>
    <li>
      New freelancers setting their first hourly rate and unsure how to price
      their services.
    </li>
    <li>
      Freelancers who usually price projects but want to understand their
      effective hourly rate.
    </li>
    <li>
      Freelancers working through platforms that charge commissions or service
      fees.
    </li>
    <li>
      Freelancers planning to adjust their rates and estimate how changes affect

<section id="why-platform-fees-matter">
  <h2>Why Platform Fees Matter</h2>

 <p>
  Many freelance platforms charge a percentage-based service fee on each payment,
  which reduces your take-home pay. If you ignore these fees when setting your
  hourly rate, you may underprice your work and miss your monthly income goals.

  <h2>How to Calculate Freelance Hourly Rate</h2>

  <p>
    Calculating your freelance hourly rate starts with understanding how much
    money you want to earn and how many hours you can realistically work.
    Unlike salaried jobs, freelancers must account for unpaid time, platform
    fees, and irregular workloads.
  </p>

  <p>
    First, set a clear monthly income goal based on your living expenses,
    savings, and financial priorities. Next, estimate how many hours per week
    you can spend on paid client work, not total working hours.
  </p>

  <p>
    Then, decide how many weeks you work per month. Most freelancers use four
    weeks, but this may vary depending on time off and workload. Finally, include
    platform fees so your rate reflects your actual take-home pay.

<!-- Common Mistakes When Pricing Hourly -->
<!-- ============================= -->
<section id="common-hourly-rate-mistakes">
  <h2>Common Mistakes Freelancers Make When Pricing Hourly</h2>

  <p>
    Many freelancers struggle with pricing, not because they lack skills, but
    because they make a few common mistakes when setting their hourly rate.
  </p>

  <h3>Why Do Freelancers Often Undercharge Their Hourly Rate?</h3>
  <p>
    One of the most common mistakes freelancers make is undercharging their
    hourly rate. This often happens because they compare themselves to salaried
    employees or other freelancers without understanding the full cost of
    freelancing.
  </p>

  <p>
    Freelancers usually have unpaid time for client communication, marketing,
    revisions, and administration. When these hours are ignored, the hourly rate
    may look acceptable on paper but result in much lower real income.
  </p>

  <h3>How Many Billable Hours Should Freelancers Actually Count?</h3>
  <p>
    Another common mistake is overestimating the number of billable hours per
    week. Many freelancers assume they can bill 40 hours per week, similar to a
    full-time job, but this is rarely realistic.
  </p>

  <p>
    Time spent on emails, meetings, finding new clients, and managing projects
    is usually unpaid. Failing to account for this leads to an hourly rate that
    does not support long-term income goals.
  </p>

  <h3>Forgetting Platform Fees and Unpaid Time</h3>
  <p>
    Many freelancers forget to include platform fees and unpaid work time when
    pricing their services. Platforms often take a percentage of each payment,
    which directly reduces take-home pay.
  </p>

  <p>
    Ignoring these factors often results in freelancers working more hours while
    earning less than expected.
  </p>

<!-- Example Calculation -->
<!-- ============================= -->
<section id="example-hourly-rate-calculation">
  <h2>Example Freelance Hourly Rate Calculation</h2>

  <p>
    Suppose your monthly income goal is <strong>$2,000</strong>. You work
    <strong>20 hours per week</strong> and <strong>4 weeks per month</strong>,
    which gives you a total of <strong>80 working hours per month</strong>.
  </p>

  <p>
    $2,000 ÷ 80 = <strong>$25 per hour</strong>.
  </p>

  <p>
    If a platform charges a <strong>10% fee</strong>, charging $25 per hour would
    not be enough to reach your income goal. To compensate for the fee, you would
    need to increase your rate to approximately <strong>$28 per hour</strong>.
  </p>

  <p>
    This example shows why considering working hours and platform fees is
    essential when calculating a realistic freelance hourly rate.

<section id="freelance-hourly-rate-faq">
  <h2>Frequently Asked Questions About Freelance Hourly Rates</h2>

  <h3>How much should I charge as a freelance hourly rate?</h3>
  <p>
    There is no single correct freelance hourly rate. The right rate depends on
    your income goals, available working hours, experience level, and expenses.
    A structured calculation based on your monthly target income is more
    reliable than copying average rates.
  </p>

  <h3>Is $25 per hour a good freelance rate?</h3>
  <p>
    A $25 hourly rate may be reasonable for some freelancers, but it depends on
    workload, location, and platform fees. For many freelancers, this rate can
    become unsustainable if unpaid time and commissions are not included.
  </p>

  <h3>How many hours should freelancers bill per week?</h3>
  <p>
    Most freelancers cannot bill 40 hours per week consistently. Billable hours
    are usually lower due to client communication, marketing, and administrative
    work. Estimating realistic billable hours helps prevent underpricing.
  </p>

  <h3>Should freelancers charge hourly or per project?</h3>
  <p>
    Both pricing models can work. Hourly pricing offers transparency, while
    project-based pricing provides clearer expectations. Many freelancers use
    hourly calculations to set a minimum rate, even when pricing projects.
  </p>

  <h3>What is the average freelance hourly rate?</h3>
  <p>
    Average freelance hourly rates vary widely by skill, experience, and market.
    Relying on averages alone can be misleading. Calculating a personalized rate
    based on your own goals and constraints is usually more effective.
